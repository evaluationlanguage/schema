        Weather forecast integration and combined ML model training not disclosed in prior art
    proof:
      source: Prior art documents D1-D4
      quote: |
        D1 Col. 4, lines 5-22: "The thermostat includes a wireless communication module
        conforming to IEEE 802.11 standards enabling connection to a home network..."
      reasoning: |
        Most features are disclosed in D1 or D2 individually. The key distinguishing
        features are the integration of external weather forecast data and the combined
        ML model that learns from preference, occupancy, AND weather data together.

          reasoning: |
            D1 discloses most features but lacks weather forecast integration.
            D2 adds occupancy detection. D3 teaches ML for energy systems.
            However, no document or combination teaches the specific combination
            of predicting setpoints based on BOTH occupancy patterns AND weather
            forecasts. The synergistic effect of combining these data sources
            for prediction would not be obvious as D3's ML approach does not
            suggest this specific combination.

          reasoning: |
            Method claim 8 includes the novel step of training an ML model on the
            combination of three data sources. While individual elements exist in
            prior art, the combination achieves a technical effect (improved
            prediction accuracy) that would not be obvious from the cited documents.
      summary: Both claims novel and inventive due to weather forecast integration
    proof:
      source: EPO Guidelines for Examination, Part G, Chapter VII
      reasoning: |
        Applying the problem-solution approach: The objective technical problem is
        "how to improve temperature setpoint prediction accuracy." The solution of
        combining weather forecast data with occupancy patterns in an ML model is
        not suggested by any of the cited documents alone or in combination.

        summary: |
          The smart thermostat application contains patentable subject matter. Both
          independent claims (1 and 8) are novel over the cited prior art and involve
          an inventive step. The key distinguishing feature - integration of external
          weather forecast data combined with occupancy-based learning - is not
          disclosed or suggested by the prior art. While D1 is highly relevant
          (X-category) for many features, it does not anticipate the claims. The
          combination of D2 and D3 (Y-category documents) does not render the claims
          obvious as neither document suggests combining weather data with occupancy
          patterns for ML-based prediction. No amendments are recommended at this stage.
      summary: Patentable - distinguishing features provide novelty and inventive step
    proof:
      source: Analysis of claims 1 and 8 against D1, D2, D3, and D4
      reasoning: |
        The X-category document D1 anticipates most features but not the weather
        integration. The Y-category combination of D2+D3 addresses occupancy and ML
        separately but does not teach their combination with weather data. Following
        EPO examination practice, the claims meet both the novelty requirement
        (Art. 54 EPC) and inventive step requirement (Art. 56 EPC).
